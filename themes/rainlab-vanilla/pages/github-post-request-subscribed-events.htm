I created this page because GitHub needed a URL to send POST requests to.  Snippit taken from github.com Settings->"Web Hooks."  https://github.com/organizations/idxos/settings/hooks/5537568

We’ll send a POST request to the URL below with details of any subscribed events. You can also specify which data format you’d like to receive (JSON, x-www-form-urlencoded, etc). More information can be found in our developer documentation.
