    <div class="body field"><p>Within the API documentation we use the following terminology:</p>
<dl>
<dt>API</dt>
<dd><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface#Web_APIs">Application programming interface</a> - the mechanism by which dealers can interact with our system. The architecture for sharing content and data between web applications.</dd>
<dt>REST</dt>
<dd><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">Representational state transfer</a> - the API HTTP methods standards by which we follow.</dd>
<dt>JSON</dt>
<dd><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JavaScript Object Notation</a> - the language independent data format that we primarily use to transmit data between servers and web applications.</dd>
<dt>Content Negotiation</dt>
<dd><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation" target="_blank">Content negotiation</a> is the client telling the server what it is sending and what it wants in return, and the server determining if it can do what the client requests.</dd>
<dt>Collection</dt>
<dd>A addressable set of entities. Typically, all entities contained in the collection are of the same type, and share the same base URI as the collection. Collections only allow GET (fetch a list) operations. Because our collections support pagination, the API will limit to a set number of items per "page" of results. For example, in the URL: api.wpswebservices.com/vendor, the <em>vendor </em>is the collection or sometimes referred to as the "service".</dd>
<dt>Entity</dt>
<dd>An addressable item being returned. Entities are distinguished by a unique identifier present in the URI. For example, in the URL: api.wpswebservices.com/item/28-1111, the <em>28-1111</em> part is an item identifier which we consider the "entity". Entities allow GET (fetch an entity) operations.</dd>
<dt>Relational Links</dt>
<dd>A URI to a resource that has the described relation. Relational links allow you to describe relations between different entities and collections, as well as directly link to them so that the web service client can perform operations on those relations. These are also sometimes called hypermedia links.</dd>
</dl>
<p>REST services return entities and collections, and provide hypermedia links between related entities and collections. Resource objects coordinate operations, and return entities and collections.</p>
